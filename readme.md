# LUNI v0.8-pre
# This readme.md ONLY includes things for the Ion Universe Public Server, regular set-up instructions over at the original UniverseServer 
1) SHA512 Hashing 
  
  - Okay, since we get a lot of heat for our current file for SHA512 hashing, I will explain it, it IS not set up correctly because all default files are setup to work to WITH md5.h & md5.cpp. You can rename the SHA512 files to md5.
2) Server Issues
  
  - Our server is run on CuzitsJonny's source code. We give him full credit as we did not make this code. Its not a full version of LEGO Universe which mean it can be unstable
  
  - The message "Server Is Under Maintence" means the world server crashed. Give it a few miniutes to restart
  
  - The message "Server Is loading resources" is self explanitory, give it a few seconds. If you spam the Enter button you will promted with a message saying to update your client. If you do, just close the client and re-open it.

3) F a Q 
 - FaQ is located here: http://ion-universe.com/f-a-q.html
